# Aster Privacy
Privacy-first security tools for everyone.

We offer **Aster Authenticator** and **Aster Email** - two products focused on keeping your accounts and communications safe with end-to-end encryption. We're currently building more tools to expand our privacy-focused ecosystem.

We shouldn't be able to read your sh*t - period. Every single Aster tool is fully end-to-end encrypted. We can't read your messages, access your accounts, or see anything you do. Zero access means zero compromise.

## Why Open Source?
Trust shouldn't be blind. Everything we build is open source so you can verify our code, report issues, and contribute improvements. Browse our repos, open issues, or submit a PR - we welcome all contributions 💖.

## Join the Community
We're always looking to connect with privacy advocates, developers, and anyone who cares about digital security. Share feedback, request features, or just say hello.
